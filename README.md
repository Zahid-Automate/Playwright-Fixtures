 ðŸŽ­ Why I Prefer Playwright Fixtures Over Storage State for E2E Testing

After extensive testing, here's why fixtures are my go-to choice:

âœ¨ Key Benefits:
- Better test isolation - each test starts fresh
- Dynamic data handling - perfect for real-world scenarios
- Reusable setup/teardown logic across test suites
- Parameterizable - easily customize per test case
- Type-safe with TypeScript support

ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip: While storage state is great for simple auth flows, fixtures shine in complex scenarios where you need:
- Dynamic user data
- Complex test environments
- Detailed setup/teardown processes
- Shared testing utilities

Real talk: Storage state has its place, but fixtures give you that extra control and flexibility that modern web testing demands.
